- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I think I could envision it pretty well after I created all the "child" classes!
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Everything seems to work well until now. I would personally think more about the "restock" method and the amount by which it should restock each ingredient. My advice would be to revise all the things you learn in class and also read the Java documentation closely when a new class comes up (e.g. HashTable) to understand more clearly.
